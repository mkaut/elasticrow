elasticrow
==========

This package introduces a new environment `elasticrow` and command `\elasticfigure` for aligning several images in one row/line so that they have the same height and, at the same time, fill a specified width, with an optionally specified white space between.
	
It is based on a [StackExchange solution by Herbert Kruitbosch](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/227935).
